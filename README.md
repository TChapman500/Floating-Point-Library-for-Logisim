# Floating Point Library for Logisim
A Logisim JAR library that adds floating point arithmatic to the simulator.  This branch is for [https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution](https://github.com/reds-heig/logisim-evolution) and uses a single, 64-bit line for double precision instead of 2, 32-bit lines (double precision not implemented yet).
